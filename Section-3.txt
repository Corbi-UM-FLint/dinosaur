Research by Matthew G. Baron, David B. Norman, and Paul M. Barrett in 2017 suggested a radical revision of dinosaurian systematics. Phylogenetic analysis by 
Baron et al. recovered the Ornithischia as being closer to the Theropoda than the Sauropodomorpha, as opposed to the traditional union of theropods with 
sauropodomorphs. They resurrected the clade Ornithoscelida to refer to the group containing Ornithischia and Theropoda. Dinosauria itself was re-defined as the 
last common ancestor of Triceratops horridus, Passer domesticus and Diplodocus carnegii, and all of its descendants, 
to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs.[12][13]
